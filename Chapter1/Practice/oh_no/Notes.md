# Notes on oh_no (practice work)

Not much to practice on in the first chapter, other than creating a new project and changing the string used in the "Hello World" example. So, that's what I've done

The program produced:
```bash
cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.00s
     Running `target/debug/oh_no`
oh no, not again
```
