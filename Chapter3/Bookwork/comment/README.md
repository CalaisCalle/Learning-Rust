# 3.4 Comments

Sometimes, extra explanation is required.
Programmers can leave comments in the source code, prefixed with `//`:

```rust
// hello, world
```

The Rust idiomatic comment style starts a comment with two slashes.
The comment continues until the end of the line.
Multi-line comments must include a `//` on each line.

// Comments can also be placed at the end of lines containing code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let lucky_number = 7; // Iâ€™m feeling lucky today
}
```
