# Chapter 3 Projects

I decided to use the projects suggested at the end of the chapter, and then try to create at least one of my own.
The suggestions from the book are

 - Convert temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
 - Generate the nth Fibonacci number.
 - Print the lyrics to the Christmas carol “The Twelve Days of Christmas,” taking advantage of the repetition in the song.

I've given each their own cargo project, since that makes sense to me.
I believe each focuses on a different aspect of the course:

 - Temperature converter: Variables and Mutability, Data Types
 - Fibonacci number: Loops
 - 12 Days of christmas: All of it together
