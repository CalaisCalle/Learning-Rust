# Chapter 4 Notes and Summary

This section contains notes and some bookwork for chapter 4.
I doubt it will include any Bookwork, since it's kind of hard to do with this section.

It's worth noting that, from this chapter onwards, the `fn main() {}` code is not included in examples.
This is just to make the examples more concise.
