# Learning-Rust
A place where I can put stuff while I learn Rust, using the book "The Rust Programming Language"

##
## Folder setup

 Generally, every chapter will be given its own folder split in two: Bookwork, and practice.
 As it sounds, the Bookwork folders will be where all code is more or less taken from the book, along with some notes.
 The "Practice" folder is where I'll put what I've learned so far into practice
